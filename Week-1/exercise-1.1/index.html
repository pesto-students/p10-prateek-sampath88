                                        followed by the inline script that logs a message
                                        to the console. This is because both of these scripts are located in the head
                                        section of the document, which is
                                        processed before the body section.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="info">
                                        Next, the browser will process the body section of the document, which contains
                                        the "Hello, world!" text and the
                                        script2.js file. The script2.js file is executed after the text because it
                                        appears lower down in the document.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info">
                                        It's worth noting that scripts that are loaded asynchronously or dynamically
                                        using JavaScript can be executed out of
                                        order. This is because these scripts do not block the loading of the rest of the
                                        page and can be executed as soon as
                                        they are loaded, even if they appear lower down in the document. As a result,
                                        it's important for web developers to
                                        carefully manage the order of script processing to ensure that their scripts
                                        execute correctly and do not interfere with
                                        each other.

                                    <p class="info">Layout and painting are two key steps in the rendering process that
                                        the browser goes through to display a web page on
                                        the screen.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info">Layout, also known as reflow, is the process by which the browser
                                        calculates the position and size of each element on
                                        the web page based on the styles applied to them. This includes the dimensions
                                        of the box that encloses each element,
                                        its position on the screen, and the placement of its content within the box. The
                                        layout process takes into account the
                                        dimensions of the viewport, as well as the size and position of any other
                                        elements on the page that may affect the
                                        layout. The layout process is expensive in terms of computation, and can be a
                                        bottleneck for performance, especially on
                                        complex web pages.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info">Once the layout has been calculated, the browser moves on to the
                                        painting phase. Painting is the process of filling in
                                        the pixels on the screen with the colors and images defined by the styles
                                        applied to each element. The painting process
                                        starts at the top of the page and proceeds downward, painting each element in
                                        turn. The painting process takes into
                                        account the visibility and stacking order of each element on the page, as well
                                        as any CSS effects such as transparency,
                                        shadows, and gradients.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="info">
                                        The painting process also involves compositing, which is the process of
                                        combining the pixels of each element with the
                                        pixels of the elements below it in the stacking order to produce the final
                                        output on the screen. Compositing involves
                                        blending the colors and images of each element using techniques such as alpha
                                        blending and blending modes.

                                        The layout and painting processes are complex and can involve a large amount of
                                        computation, especially on complex web
                                        pages with many elements and styles. To optimize performance, modern browsers
                                        use a variety of techniques such as
                                        caching, pre-fetching, and lazy loading to minimize the amount of work required
                                        for layout and painting, and to ensure
                                        that the web page is displayed as quickly and smoothly as possible.
